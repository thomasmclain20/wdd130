      What is Emulation City?
      My site, to put it simply, is a place for people to come and reclaim their lost childhood in video games. 
      In todays video game industry, we dont see many efforts to preserve old games, no matter how beloved they are. 
      Whether it is due to companies moving on to more modern games or wanting to push newer technology, we see many old consoles/games being left behind. 
      This leads to many older games being left to third-party sources or scalpers, who will then sell them for far more than they are worth. 
      Emulation City seeks to change that by making older games and the consoles that can run them more available either through modification of an existing system or through emulation.
